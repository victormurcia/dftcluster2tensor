# dftcluster2tensor
Application for converting DFT-calculated NEXAFS spectra into quantitatively refined optical tensors. The tool applies a hierarchical clustering algorithm to reduce transition complexity, enabling robust fitting to experimental spectra and chemical moiety-level analysis of X-ray optical response.
